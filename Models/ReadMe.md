# Lucifer Protein Simulation
--------------
## Purpose
This simulation was created combining all the models to help build different components.
It was created to help the wet lab predict how the spectra might look as well as create sample data for the Raw Data and 
Image Comparision verification.

See http://2017.igem.org/Team:UNOTT/Software for more details

# Python Models
--------------
## Purpose
This was developed to test the Ordinary Diffrential Equations by creating visualisations of them.

See http://2017.igem.org/Team:UNOTT/Modelling for more details

# Combination Calculator 
------------
## Purpose
This was developed as an easy non-programming way to tweak and create random combinations in the form of an Excel Sheet.

## Installation
Simply download and use LibreOffice Calculator or Microsoft Excel to run

## Usage
To use this, edit the fields in the Protein Concentration fields on Sheet1 to change how the spectra will look depending on which combination of proteins you use.
