# Python Models
--------------
## Purpose
This was developed to test the Ordinary Diffrential Equations by creating visualisations of them.

These models were all integrated into Lucifer Fluorescence Simulator as each model was used to build a certain component of the simulation. However, due to time constraints, each model couldn't be validated with real world data.

## Installation 
Prequisites: You need Tellurium and Python

```
LINUX: To install Tellurium, use: http://tellurium.analogmachine.org/
```

## Usage
Run the scripts onto any Python IDE of your choice once Tellurium is loaded and it should work.
