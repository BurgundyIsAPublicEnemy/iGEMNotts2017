# Raw Data Comparision
--------------
## Purpose
 This was developed with the intenton of allowing comparision between two sets of data pulled from a fluorescence reader in the lab to verify whether the user is let in or not. This was developed in Java, which is supported by all machines. This allowed it to be ported to a Raspberry Pi. 
 
 
 ## Installation 
 Raw Data Comparision, at the current state, is unstable. Please download the source code and manually change the code to support your own file directory.
 
 ```
LINUX: To compile, in Terminal, navigate to directory with .java files and type: java read_gfp.java
 ```
 ```
 LINUX: To run, in Terminal, navigate to directory with .class files and type: javac read_gfp
 ```
 
 # Usage
 HAVEN'T TESTED ON WINDOWS / MAC
 
 Use CVS format. Make sure the directory goes to that .cvs file. This .cvs file must be from the fluorescence reader to work. Make sure the format matches the code. Then run.
