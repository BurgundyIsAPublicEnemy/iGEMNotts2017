# Raw Data Comparision
--------------
## Purpose
This was developed with the intenton of allowing comparision between two sets of data pulled from a fluorescence reader in the lab to verify whether the user is let in or not. This was developed in Java, which is supported by all machines. This allowed it to be ported to a Raspberry Pi. 


## Installation 
Raw Data Comparision, at the current state, is unstable. Please download the source code and manually change the code to support your own file directory.
