# Image Comparision
--------------
## Purpose
Image Comparision was developed with the intentions of allowing two images of the same size and which are of type Bitmap to compare each other. This is very useful as the if the spectra was in an image form, this allows them to be compared still, without needing the raw data which means Key.Coli can work with graphs.


# Raw Data Comparision
--------------
## Purpose
This was developed with the intenton of allowing comparision between two sets of data pulled from a fluorescence reader in the lab to verify whether the user is let in or not. This was developed in Java, which is supported by all machines. This allowed it to be ported to a Raspberry Pi. 

# In Dev
------------
These are old builds / experiments. Unsupported but kept for a reference.
