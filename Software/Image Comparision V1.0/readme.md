# Image Comparision
--------------
## Purpose
Image Comparision was developed with the intentions of allowing two images of the same size and which are of type Bitmap to compare each other. This is very useful as the if the spectra was in an image form, this allows them to be compared still, without needing the raw data which means Key.Coli can work with graphs.

## Installation 
Image Comparision was developed using C#. Currently, stable.

```
Simply click the .exe file to download it. This will only work on Windows. If you want, you can download the source .zip file and port it over to your machine of choice.
```

## Usage
Select the image you'd like to use, then select the second. They must be the same size and be bitmaps.
Furthermore, to change the threshold, change the number then click the button. It will not change unless you do that.
Hit Compare to check for similarity and to know if you are verified
